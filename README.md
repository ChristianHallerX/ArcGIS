# ArcGIS Projects

This folder showcases projects in ArcGis Desktop, Pro, and Online.

### Australia Forest Fires (ArcGIS Desktop)

This project explores the use of imagery classification for gauging extent of vegetation loss in the Australian eastern mountainous regions around ACT, Victoria, and New South Wales. The project introduces Landsat imagery to compile the NDVI index comapring 2019 (pre-fire) and 2020 (immediate post-fire) states of vegetation.


### Agricultural Yield Management Zones (ArcGIS Pro)

"Precision agriculture", or precision farming, is therefore a farming concept that utilizes geographical information to determine field variability to ensure optimal use of inputs and maximize the output from a farm. This small project uses soil and many other ground-sampled data in combination with remotely sensed data to improve fertilizer distribution.
The project makes use of these data to train a machine learning model that predicts a fertilizer score.


### Bike Mapper Native apps (App Studio)

An app for smart phones built in AppStudio used for crowd-sourcing locations: Bike Lockers, Bike Shops, Bike Parking.

### Burn Scar Recovery (ArcGIS Pro)

Using multiband satellite imagery, this quantitative burn-scar assessment maeasures the destruction and recovery of vegetation patterns in the Australian bush.


### GIS Specialization

Files and exercise data from the University of California Davis 20-week training (Spring 2020)


### Northridge Earthquake (ArcGIS Pro)

Projection and damage assessment of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake in Los Angeles County, California. Using ArcGIS Pro's 3d-scene capabilities, visualization of the building damages and aftershock hypocenters (i.e. subsurface) becomes easy and instructive.

### Ozone Warning in California (ArcGIS Desktop)

Is the noxious gas ozone (O3) in California correlated with wealth or elevation? Which counties are impacted the most. This brief summary map combines State demographic information with environmental measurement data.



### Reconstructing the paleo Lake Bonneville (ArcGIS Desktop)

This project uses DEM data to calculate volumes and fluxes of the ancestor of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Have a look at the article on the website and videos linked there: <a href="https://christianhallerx.github.io/research/2020-05-06-Bonneville/" target="_blank">Link to article.</a>
